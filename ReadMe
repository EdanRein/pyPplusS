What is pyppluss?
This is a code package accompanying the paper Fast and precise light-curve model for transiting exoplanets with rings (doi: 10.1093/mnras/stz2556, ads bibcode: 2019MNRAS.490.1111R).
pyppluss is a model for the light curve of ringed exoplanets transitsâ€™ for uniform and limb darkened stars. The calculation is done using the Polygon+Segments algorithm, described in the above paper.

What does pyppluss do?
pyppluss provides calculation of light curves for ringed, oblate or spherical exoplanets in both the uniform and limb darkened cases.

The package is split into five files:
- polygon_plus_segments is an implementation of the Polygon+Segments algorithm described in the above paper.
- segment_models contains functions for modelling light curves in the uniform and limb darkened cases.
- err_order_fin is a script described in appendix C, to decide what order should the numerical integration be done.
- base_functions contains a variety of ``low-level'' helpers.
- fastqs is a python implementation of the Fast Quartic Solver described by Strobach (2010), see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042710002128

Detailed descriptions of all inputs and outputs are given by comment lines and documentation text in the code.
